Hi there, I am Lin who doing SIT725 this tri.
and this is my individual project.

This site is a forum-like feature called fish map. Users can upload their own experiences and pictures to showcase their catches.

Click to share your fishes! To share your own harvest, when you click, a table will appear in the first column where you can enter the text you want to enter, such as how to catch fish. In the second column, you can upload photos of your catches, and you can select the photos locally. Finally, click Submit in the lower right corner to complete the upload, and the upload will be successful. The uploaded image and text will be displayed on the page immediately after clicking OK.

Thank you for try this code, I just wanna pass the unit.
